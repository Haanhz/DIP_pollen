Modification on project compare to the presentation:

- Comparison of model's performance with the standard input size (224x224) and the reduced input size (128x128).

- Comparison of model's performance with and without data augmentation.

- Use the model with standard input size and data augmentation to analyze the impact of the dataset on the model

+ Correlation between recall metric and number of images in each class.

+ Detecting class that often being misclassified, and class often receive misclassification.

+ Analyze the problem.

- Compare the model which uses standard input size and data augmentation with other models' performance in the paper: Pollen grain classification using some convolutional neural network architectures.

Result of experiments can be seen in the slide, further analysis is stated in the report.
